This is a time-taking, manual taskwhich is a big challenge for our customers today. This may also involve merging different image assetsand backgrounds and automating the process of developing creative assets. We envision using GenAItechnology and embed that into our enterprise product to make it easier for customers at large.2.Jivox IQ uses \"Creative Masters\" which are HTML5 or Adobe After Effects files as aninput for automated creative versioning. As of today, brands hire creative agencies to develop thesecreative masters which is slow and costly process. We envision using Generative AI to churn out fullfledged HTML5 masters or videos which can be directly imported into Jivox IQ platform for creativeversioning.3.Jivox IQ uses \"Creative Masters\" which are HTML5 files as an input for automatedcreative versioning. The creative master defines the elements that would be in the ad, for example acopy (text), a call-to-action, a product image, etc. and their relative placement in the ad. Hence,different ad sizes would require different creative masters, adding on to the manual task of buildingcreative masters. The problem statement here is to develop a prototype that would automate layingout the ad elements for different ad sizes using one ad size as a reference.4.Jivox IQ integrates with bunch of third party applications using APIs.

For signing in-house developed marketplace apps, current signing process, is unsafe because the same private key and certificate are used for Helios HTTPS server.For signing 3rd party developed apps we are embedding the same helios private key in “Devportal” service binary, and this should be avoided.Perf debugging tool - given multiple perf traces captured for a workload, identify differences (eg. different number of ops/OIO, latencies etc) which can aid debugging.Cluster anomaly detection - given some metrics, identify when some major change occurred in them and try to map to events like addition of protection jobs or change in DCR/node removal/gflags being setManage rigel deployment from magneto on-demand basisSimplify cluster claim. Make it seamless to work 100% of the time.Simplify credential management for cluster deployment and claim. Currently, the AWS credentials need to be manually updated in yaml files and they expire every 8-12 hours with the process needing a repeat again. We need to automate credential management so that the developer is only concerned with working with code and not the infra. Another benefit of this project would be collaborative dev and test where multiple developers can share a setup and push their images.Many FIs are generated during NAS restore because of lack of privilege of the configured recovery user. This feature allows the customer admin to run a test backup and recovery workflow. Test run can generate a small data set, back it up, run recovery, do a cleanup and provide a report. Based on the time available, we could improve the test to use each of the Ip address of the source provided which further catches user and configuration errors.Currently windows agents has no traceability and instrumentation support. Helps in improving debuggability and instrumentation of windows agent, plus we can integrate to provide more accurate stats for the agents",

The proposed solution aims to solve this using acoustic monitoring instead - buffaloes are known to “bellow” strongly which can be easily picked up by a microphone and the high frequency nature of acoustic sensors versus an inertial sensor helps better detect the rhythmic low energy nature of rumination.

During origin licensing, it is estimated that many thousandsof sites are bound by inactive replicative helicases in each human cell.

The function of p53 is to prevent thecell from becoming cancerous by controlling its cell division. Thus, mutations in p53 can lead to loss offunction and the progress of cancer in about 50% of reported human cancers. The aggregates of p53have been observed in malignant cancers. Cell models have been used to demonstrate the loss offunction and onset of tumors during p53 amyloid formation. p53 is a 393 amino acid long protein withthree major domains: N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), core DNA binding domain (DBD)and tetramerization domain (TD). Cancers reported with p53 mutations have a higher frequency ofmutations in the DBD of p53. The outcome of all these mutations is the inability of p53 to bind to itstarget DNA sequence. Some of these mutations also show enhanced aggregation tendencies. Thismutated p53 can seed the in-vivo wt-p53 to form aggregates, a prion-like property. The project involvesmainly use of magic angle spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and possibly solution-stateNMR, combined with other structural and biophysics techniques to characterize the structure of p53amyloids. Further proton detected solid-state NMR methods development may become part of theproject depending on the candidate’s interest.Skill sets: Principles of Biophysics and biochemistry, protein expression and purification, passion forsolving puzzles.Traits expectation: ability to work, analyze data and solve problems with focus on understanding anddesire for details.Expected learning: p53 protein handling and biophysics, overexpression and purification of protein, NMRspectroscopy for structural characterization of amyloid, NMR data analysis.Specific courses required for project execution: Basic Mathematics, understanding of amino acids andProtein science, ability to work on computer.,Project 5 Title: Understanding the mechanism of Li-ion intercalation in multilayer graphene sheetsDescription: Lithiated graphitic materials are employed as anodes in several Li-ion based batteries.
