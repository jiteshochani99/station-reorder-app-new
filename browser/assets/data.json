This is a time-taking, manual taskwhich is a big challenge for our customers today. This may also involve merging different image assetsand backgrounds and automating the process of developing creative assets. We envision using GenAItechnology and embed that into our enterprise product to make it easier for customers at large.2.Jivox IQ uses \"Creative Masters\" which are HTML5 or Adobe After Effects files as aninput for automated creative versioning. As of today, brands hire creative agencies to develop thesecreative masters which is slow and costly process. We envision using Generative AI to churn out fullfledged HTML5 masters or videos which can be directly imported into Jivox IQ platform for creativeversioning.3.Jivox IQ uses \"Creative Masters\" which are HTML5 files as an input for automatedcreative versioning. The creative master defines the elements that would be in the ad, for example acopy (text), a call-to-action, a product image, etc. and their relative placement in the ad. Hence,different ad sizes would require different creative masters, adding on to the manual task of buildingcreative masters. The problem statement here is to develop a prototype that would automate layingout the ad elements for different ad sizes using one ad size as a reference.4.Jivox IQ integrates with bunch of third party applications using APIs. As part of thisproject, we envision to integrate with some of the trafficking and creative tools into the Jivox IQplatform to automate any manual workflows for our customers and users.

For signing in-house developed marketplace apps, current signing process, is unsafe because the same private key and certificate are used for Helios HTTPS server.For signing 3rd party developed apps we are embedding the same helios private key in \u201cDevportal\u201d service binary, and this should be avoided.Perf debugging tool - given multiple perf traces captured for a workload, identify differences (eg. different number of ops/OIO, latencies etc) which can aid debugging.Cluster anomaly detection - given some metrics, identify when some major change occurred in them and try to map to events like addition of protection jobs or change in DCR/node removal/gflags being setManage rigel deployment from magneto on-demand basisSimplify cluster claim. Make it seamless to work 100% of the time.Simplify credential management for cluster deployment and claim. Currently, the AWS credentials need to be manually updated in yaml files and they expire every 8-12 hours with the process needing a repeat again. We need to automate credential management so that the developer is only concerned with working with code and not the infra. Another benefit of this project would be collaborative dev and test where multiple developers can share a setup and push their images.Many FIs are generated during NAS restore because of lack of privilege of the configured recovery user. This feature allows the customer admin to run a test backup and recovery workflow. Test run can generate a small data set, back it up, run recovery, do a cleanup and provide a report. Based on the time available, we could improve the test to use each of the Ip address of the source provided which further catches user and configuration errors.Currently windows agents has no traceability and instrumentation support. Helps in improving debuggability and instrumentation of windows agent, plus we can integrate to provide more accurate stats for the agents",

The proposed solution aims to solve this using acoustic monitoring instead - buffaloes are known to \u201cbellow\u201d strongly which can be easily picked up by a microphone and the high frequency nature of acoustic sensors versus an inertial sensor helps better detect the rhythmic low energy nature of rumination.

The function of p53 is to prevent thecell from becoming cancerous by controlling its cell division. Thus, mutations in p53 can lead to loss offunction and the progress of cancer in about 50% of reported human cancers. The aggregates of p53have been observed in malignant cancers. Cell models have been used to demonstrate the loss offunction and onset of tumors during p53 amyloid formation. p53 is a 393 amino acid long protein withthree major domains: N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), core DNA binding domain (DBD)and tetramerization domain (TD). Cancers reported with p53 mutations have a higher frequency ofmutations in the DBD of p53. The outcome of all these mutations is the inability of p53 to bind to itstarget DNA sequence. Some of these mutations also show enhanced aggregation tendencies. Thismutated p53 can seed the in-vivo wt-p53 to form aggregates, a prion-like property. The project involvesmainly use of magic angle spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and possibly solution-stateNMR, combined with other structural and biophysics techniques to characterize the structure of p53amyloids. Further proton detected solid-state NMR methods development may become part of theproject depending on the candidate\u2019s interest.Skill sets: Principles of Biophysics and biochemistry, protein expression and purification, passion forsolving puzzles.Traits expectation: ability to work, analyze data and solve problems with focus on understanding anddesire for details.Expected learning: p53 protein handling and biophysics, overexpression and purification of protein, NMRspectroscopy for structural characterization of amyloid, NMR data analysis.Specific courses required for project execution: Basic Mathematics, understanding of amino acids andProtein science, ability to work on computer.,Project 5 Title: Understanding the mechanism of Li-ion intercalation in multilayer graphene sheetsDescription: Lithiated graphitic materials are employed as anodes in several Li-ion based batteries.

Sitters, or one-to-one observers, arecommonly used in inpatient settings to meet monitoring needs of high-riskpatients. Utilizing AI/ML based video analytics technology such as continuousvideo monitoring can relieve sitters to allow for optimal productivity, increasedsafety, cost reduction, and nurse/family satisfaction. The project involves buildingAI/ML driven video analytics module to monitor patients as well as surveillanceof people in contact with the patient as well as the surrounding facilities. Oncean anomaly id identified, the system should push them to the nursing staff.Intelligent Document ProcessingGlobally about 80-90% of all data is unstructured. Insurance companies have alarge and rapidly growing unstructured data content and many of them do nothaving the ability to make use of it to take the right business decisions.Unstructured content includes Policy Documents, Claims Documents, AnnualReports, Emails, Broker Submissions, Knowledge Repositories, paper documentsetc. The Intelligent Document Processing engine executes documentpre-processing using image analytics and readies the document for informationextraction. The extracted data is them analysed using NLP techniques andcorrected for errors, thereby ensuring an extremely high degree of dataextraction accuracy. The engine checks for inter-field validity and flags values thatoccur with low confidence to call for manual intervention.Hospital Readmission PredictionA hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital,gets re-admitted again within a certain period such as 30 days, after thedischarge. Hospital readmission prediction involves learning from historicalmedical data to predict probability of a patient returning to hospital in a certainperiod after the discharge. The objective is to help health providers improvequality of care, deliver better treatment, lower hospital readmission rate, andreduce the medical costs. This project aims to achieve Interpretable &amp;Explainable Machine Learning results for the following questions:How accurately can we predict hospital readmission?What factors are the strongest predictors of hospital readmissions in a certaindisease category?\u00a9 2022 HARMAN International | services.harman.comClaims AnalyticsInsurers rely on rule-based engines which raise alerts for Claims fraud in casualtyinsurance. A large team triages these alerts and select the candidate claims forfurther investigation. There is also the problem of False positives, where only asmall percentage of the of the validated claims turn out to be actual fraudulentclaims. Businesses can automate the triaging process with AI model validatingFraudulent claim alerts using multivariate data. Create features from themultivariate data along with the associated claims description (free text). Robustmachine learning algorithms to create models with &lt;0.2% false negatives andnone of the actual fraudulent claims being missed. Reduce the number of alertsto be reviewed by the triage team by 90%. Incorporate model explainability.Smart Medical Devices ManagementPredictive Intelligence to monitor and predict the health of devices, based onusage and log data. The objective is to help the monitoring and maintenanceteam to get device intelligence data on a regular basis and predict and visualizethe data so they can take preventive actions. Key features of the solution includeDevice Monitoring, Device Health Prediction, Workflow Management,Omni-channel support through cloud based always on dashboard. The internwill work on key features of the solution and build descriptive and predictiveAI/ML models.Cybersecurity Asset ManagementHARMAN Cybersecurity Asset Management Platform helps enterprises keeptheir IT systems safe and secure using real-time threat intelligence analytics.
