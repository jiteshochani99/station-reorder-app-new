However, investigation of these processes in the earliest phase, althoughcritically important, is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop single molecule sensitive techniquesthat can help visualize and characterize these events. We are working to develop microscopy andspectroscopy techniques to characterize the liquid liquid phase separation of proteins such as tau proteinthat are involved in the pathology of diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.Skill sets: knowledge of physics, coding, electronics, engineeringTraits expectation: interest in building techniques, coding and data analysisExpected learning: experience with developing state of the art methodologies in biophysical experimentsSpecific courses required for project execution: physics and/or engineering coursesProject 8 Title: Determinants of Mammalian origin of replication selectionDescription: In eukaryotes, replication initiation is determined by two temporally decoupled sequentialsteps; replication origin licensing and firing. During origin licensing, it is estimated that many thousandsof sites are bound by inactive replicative helicases in each human cell. However, no discerniblesequence or proteomic profile has been conclusively attributed to origin sites in mammalian cells.Influence of DNA structure and epigenetic context on the origin selection and replication timing will beexplored.Skill sets: Understanding of DNA and protein structure and interactions.Traits expectation: Interested in DNA replication and repair.Expected learning: Cell culture, DNA fibre, flow cytometry, genome editing.Specific courses required for project execution: Biochemistry, Molecular biology,Project10Title: Structural Characterization of Aggregating and Phase Separated ProteinsWe are interested in the structural characterization and structural differentiation of amyloids formed bythe wt- and the mutant p53 DNA binding domain. p53 is a transcription factor that inhibits genes requiredfor cell cycle progression and activates genes leading to apoptosis. The function of p53 is to prevent thecell from becoming cancerous by controlling its cell division. Thus, mutations in p53 can lead to loss offunction and the progress of cancer in about 50% of reported human cancers. The aggregates of p53have been observed in malignant cancers. Cell models have been used to demonstrate the loss offunction and onset of tumors during p53 amyloid formation. p53 is a 393 amino acid long protein withthree major domains: N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), core DNA binding domain (DBD)and tetramerization domain (TD). Cancers reported with p53 mutations have a higher frequency ofmutations in the DBD of p53. The outcome of all these mutations is the inability of p53 to bind to itstarget DNA sequence. Some of these mutations also show enhanced aggregation tendencies. Thismutated p53 can seed the in-vivo wt-p53 to form aggregates, a prion-like property. The project involvesmainly use of magic angle spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and possibly solution-stateNMR, combined with other structural and biophysics techniques to characterize the structure of p53amyloids. Further proton detected solid-state NMR methods development may become part of theproject depending on the candidate’s interest.Skill sets: Principles of Biophysics and biochemistry, protein expression and purification, passion forsolving puzzles.Traits expectation: ability to work, analyze data and solve problems with focus on understanding anddesire for details.Expected learning: p53 protein handling and biophysics, overexpression and purification of protein, NMRspectroscopy for structural characterization of amyloid, NMR data analysis.Specific courses required for project execution: Basic Mathematics, understanding of amino acids andProtein science, ability to work on computer.,Project 5 Title: Understanding the mechanism of Li-ion intercalation in multilayer graphene sheetsDescription: Lithiated graphitic materials are employed as anodes in several Li-ion based batteries.
